**Here I have used three containers to dockerize three main things that we require to make a complete web application containing
react app as a frontend then node app as a backend and then a Mongo database for storing data and managing data. Here I used get request and post request to access or retrieve and post data respectively. Please see the code files to get complete details.
See you in the pull Request. Thanks!**
